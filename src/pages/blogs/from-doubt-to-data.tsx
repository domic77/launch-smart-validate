              <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">Every founder knows the feeling. The gnawing doubt, the uncertainty of whether you’re building something people actually want. You can spend months, even years, chasing an idea that’s ultimately a dead end. But what if you could replace that doubt with data?</p>
              <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">That’s the power of iValidate. We help you get real market feedback, so you can build with confidence.</p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">The Old Way: Guesswork and Gut Feelings</h3>
              <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">For too long, founders have relied on guesswork and gut feelings to validate their ideas. They’ve conducted surveys, interviewed friends and family, and built MVPs based on assumptions. But these methods are often flawed and can lead to a false sense of security.</p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">The iValidate Way: Real-Time Signals</h3>
