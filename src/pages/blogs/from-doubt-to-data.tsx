              <p>Every founder knows the feeling. The gnawing doubt, the uncertainty of whether you’re building something people actually want. You can spend months, even years, chasing an idea that’s ultimately a dead end. But what if you could replace that doubt with data?</p>
              <p>That’s the power of iValidate. We help you get real market feedback, so you can build with confidence.</p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Old Way: Guesswork and Gut Feelings</h3>
              <p>For too long, founders have relied on guesswork and gut feelings to validate their ideas. They’ve conducted surveys, interviewed friends and family, and built MVPs based on assumptions. But these methods are often flawed and can lead to a false sense of security.</p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The iValidate Way: Real-Time Signals</h3>
              <p>iValidate gives you access to real-time market signals, so you can see what people are actually searching for, talking about, and buying. We analyze data from a variety of sources, including:</p>

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Keyword Demand:</strong> We analyze Google search data to see how many people are searching for your solution.</li>
                <li><strong>User Sentiment:</strong> We monitor social media conversations to see what people are saying about your industry and competitors.</li>
