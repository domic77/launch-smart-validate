              <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">To connect a new integration, follow these simple steps:</p>
              <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4 text-foreground">
                <li>Navigate to the "Integrations" tab in your project settings.</li>
                <li>From the list of available integrations, select the platform you want to connect (e.g., Google Trends, Reddit, Twitter).</li>
                <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to authorize iValidate. This may involve logging into your account on the respective platform and granting necessary permissions, or providing an API key.</li>
                <li>Once successfully connected, you will see a confirmation message, and the integration will be listed as active in your settings.</li>
              </ol>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">Managing Connected Integrations</h3>
              <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">In the "Integrations" tab, you can also manage your existing connections. You can:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-foreground">
                <li><strong>View Status:</strong> Check the connection status of each integration.</li>
                <li><strong>Disconnect:</strong> Remove an integration if you no longer need it.</li>
                <li><strong>Reauthorize:</strong> If an integration connection expires or encounters an issue, you may need to reauthorize it.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">Ensuring your integrations are active and properly configured is crucial for receiving the most accurate and comprehensive validation reports.</p>
